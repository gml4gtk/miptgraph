# MIPT-VIS Project #
The project is developed in the Intel-MIPT students laboratory by a group of students from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology( MIPT) under Intel employees mentoring.
Mipt-vis is an open source tool that helps you to visualize compiler-specific graphs. It is also capable for performing different analyses on graphs.
Primary goal is to implement user interface, layout algorithm and import of IR dumps from GCC and ICC.

In its primary intention MIPT\_VIS is an educational project that gives its members more knowledge about compiler science and work in team.
Project is divided into four components - each one with its own mentor.
These components are:
  * GUI - mentor Lev Rumyantsev
  * Graph placement - mentor Boris Shurygin
  * Graph analyses - mentor Michael Zolotukhin
  * Parser - mentor Ivan Sidorenko
