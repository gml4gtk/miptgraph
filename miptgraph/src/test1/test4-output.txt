Layout test started..
added node in g2 p2[0] with id 0
added node in g2 p2[1] with id 1
added node in g2 p2[2] with id 2
added node in g2 p2[3] with id 3
added node in g2 p2[4] with id 4
added edge in g2 with id 2 between node 0 and node 0 with id -1
before layout
Dumping graph id:2 (5 nodes, 5 real nodes, 0 dummy nodes, 0 edges, 0 horizontal edges, 1 selfedges 0 reversed edges)
Nodes:
Node id 0: (1 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 1: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 2: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 3: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 4: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Edges:
Ordering::Dump() there are 1 levels
Level rank 0 has these 5 nodes:
  id:0(20,0) id:1(35,0) id:2(50,0) id:3(65,0) id:4(80,0)
}
Graph has 5 starter nodes and 1 ranks
Ordering::Dump() there are 1 levels
Level rank 0 has these 5 nodes:
  id:0(20,0) id:1(35,0) id:2(50,0) id:3(65,0) id:4(80,0)
Final Crossings: 0
after layout of graph 2 with optional dummy nodes and changed edges
Dumping graph id:2 (5 nodes, 5 real nodes, 0 dummy nodes, 0 edges, 0 horizontal edges, 1 selfedges 0 reversed edges)
Nodes:
Node id 0: (1 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 1: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 2: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 3: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Node id 4: (0 self-edges size (10,10) 0 in-edges 0 out-edges)
Edges:
node id 0 is at position (20,0)
node id 1 is at position (35,0)
node id 2 is at position (50,0)
node id 3 is at position (65,0)
node id 4 is at position (80,0)
