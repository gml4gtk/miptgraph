Layout test started..
added node in g2 p2[0] with id 0
added node in g2 p2[1] with id 1
added node in g2 p2[2] with id 2
added node in g2 p2[3] with id 3
added node in g2 p2[4] with id 4
added edge in g2 with id 2 between node 0 and node 0 with id 0
before layout
Dumping graph id:2 (5 nodes, 5 real nodes, 0 dummy nodes, 0 edges, 0 horizontal edges, 1 selfedges 0 reversed edges)
