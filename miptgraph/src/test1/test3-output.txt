Layout test started..
added node in g2 p2[0] with id 0
added node in g2 p2[1] with id 1
added node in g2 p2[2] with id 2
added node in g2 p2[3] with id 3
added node in g2 p2[4] with id 4
added edge in g2 with id 2 between node 0 and node 1 with id 0
added edge in g2 between node 1 and node 2 with id 1
added edge in g2 between node 2 and node 3 with id 2
added edge in g2 between node 3 and node 1 with id 3
added edge in g2 between node 3 and node 4 with id 4
before layout
Dumping graph id:2 (5 nodes, 5 real nodes, 0 dummy nodes, 5 edges, 0 selfedges 0 reversed edges)
Nodes:
Node id 0: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges:
  Out edges: 0->1
Node id 1: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 0->1 3->1
  Out edges: 1->2
Node id 2: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 1->2
  Out edges: 2->3
Node id 3: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 2->3
  Out edges: 3->1 3->4
Node id 4: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 3->4
  Out edges:
Edges:
Edge id 0: 0->1 rev=0
Edge id 1: 1->2 rev=0
Edge id 2: 2->3 rev=0
Edge id 3: 3->1 rev=0
Edge id 4: 3->4 rev=0
Reversed edges changed to 1
edge crossings reduced from 0 to 0
Level rank 0 has these 1 nodes:
  id:0(32,0)
Level rank 1 has these 1 nodes:
  id:1(32,80)
Level rank 2 has these 2 nodes:
  id:5(20,160) id:2(70,160)
Level rank 3 has these 1 nodes:
  id:3(32,240)
Level rank 4 has these 1 nodes:
  id:4(32,320)
Final Crossings: 0
after layout of graph 2 with dummy nodes and changed edges
Dumping graph id:2 (6 nodes, 5 real nodes, 1 dummy nodes, 6 edges, 0 selfedges 1 reversed edges)
Nodes:
Node id 0: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges:
  Out edges: 0->1
Node id 1: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 0->1
  Out edges: 1->2 1->5
Node id 2: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 1->2
  Out edges: 2->3
Node id 3: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 2->3 5->3
  Out edges: 3->4
Node id 4: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 3->4
  Out edges:
Node id 5: (0 self-edges)
  In  edges: 1->5
  Out edges: 5->3
Edges:
Edge id 0: 0->1 rev=0
Edge id 1: 1->2 rev=0
Edge id 2: 2->3 rev=0
Edge id 4: 3->4 rev=0
Edge id 5: 1->5 rev=1
Edge id 6: 5->3 rev=1
edge 3->1 should be reversed via dummy node 5
graph 2 maxrank = 4
