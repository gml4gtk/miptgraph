edge crossings reduced from 15 to 10
edge crossings did not reduce from current 10 to 11
edge crossings reduced from 10 to 10
improved from 10 to 9 crossings at try 1
improved from 9 to 8 crossings at try 1
improved from 8 to 6 crossings at try 1
improved from 6 to 5 crossings at try 1
edge crossings reduced from 5 to 5
improved from 4 to 3 crossings at try 1
edge crossings reduced from 4 to 4
