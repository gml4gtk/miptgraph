- edge between nodes in different graph can be a feature
- fixed: added way to set and get uniq id number of graph
- fixed: added test with cycle in the graph
- fixed: add support for self-edges at a node added in node, edge, graph
- edge reverse() to/from edges of nodes is oke?
- in ~LEdge delete composite edges
- in breaklongedge, n<0 todo
- fixed: in Lgraph WeightedMedianHeuristic() must be <= t crossings documented
- fixed: added dummy node count in graph
- add interface code to use it from plain c
- in split edge longedges composite edges list in every sub edges todo why needed?
