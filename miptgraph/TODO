- graph.cpp destroy() edges todo
- graph.cpp creategraphwith single node todo
- fixed: layout() crashes in countcrossings if there are no nodes
- layout() if there are nodes, but no edges todo
- edge between nodes in different graph can be a feature
- fixed: added way to set and get uniq id number of graph
- fixed: added test with cycle in the graph
- fixed: add support for self-edges at a node added in node, edge, graph
- edge reverse() to/from edges of nodes is oke?
- fixed: in ~LEdge delete composite edges
- in breaklongedge, n<0 todo
- fixed: in Lgraph WeightedMedianHeuristic() must be <= t crossings documented
- fixed: added dummy node count in graph
- fixed: add interface code to use it from plain c
- fixed: added cmiptgraph.h for use with c source
- fixed: in split edge longedges composite edges list in every sub edges todo why needed?
- fixed: self-edges check added in ledge.h
- lgraph InitCoordinates should be flexible in node sizes and y level rank spacing
- fixed: test a no-edges graph
- fixed: special layout mode if there are no edges
- add tree layout mode if it is tree data that can be done faster
- fixed: in ledge CompositeEdgesDump() etc to remove
- graph::destroy() todo
- fixed: delete self edges
- double spacing for same edge 1->2 1->2
- edge labels
- placement in variable raster, prio algo
- fixed: changed to stable_sort() in layout.cpp
- fixed: added count of reversed edges
- fixed: composite edges lists removed
- node xy size to add
- fixed: bool layouted changed into int layouted
- re-layout should be possible after layout
- fixed: horizontal edge bool added and counter
- fixed: added check on horizontal edges in IsAdjacentToNode
- fixed: if (rank < order_vector.size()) to check in AdjOutPositions
- reversereversededges() maybe at end of layout()
- add position only routine()
- fixed: added x,y spacing and node x,y size
- fixed: test1: improved from 4 to 3 crossings at try 1 and then: edge crossings reduced from 4 to 4
- fixed: added count of starter nodes
- test in reversereverse causes segv in rank()
- fixed: added left/right nodes in rank order to node data for later use
- fixed: added check on nodes in order data before start of barycenter
- use dfs to fill initial order with nodes
- test7.cpp as test for priority placement
- fixed: added node center (x,y) point
- fixed: first part of helper program miptgml with gtk-2 gui
- fixed: added screenshot gtk+ miptgml gui program
- fixed: parsing gml graph in gtk+ gui using peg parser
- fixed: parsing gml data into datastructs and ready to layout
- fixed: first run of layouter from gml graph file
- fixed: layout and draw in gtk gui and new screenshot of the miptgml program
- fixed: upgraded the c interface to use with gtk+ libs
- qvge running with this layouter instead of ogdf v 043 in qvge-gml or v 05.5
- ogdf placement algo
- fixed: updated node median values as ogdf does it
- fixed: edge line drawing using edge id
- findnode, findedge search
- fixed: edge attribs handling as color, linestyle
- fixed: selfedges do not need edge number, they now have id -1
- fixed: median value of node
- layout of fine-tune gml is wrong for the start nodes positions
- fixed: added bool if edge is a inner edge
