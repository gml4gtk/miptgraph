# Intel Compiler Dump Viewer (ICDV)

The project is developed in the Intel-MIPT students laboratory by a group of students from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology( MIPT) under Intel employees mentoring. ICDV is an open source tool for compiler-specific graphs visualization. Primary goal is to implement user interface, layout algorithm and import of IR dumps from ICC.

The primary intention of the project is educational, i.e. to give its members more knowledge about compiler science and work in team.

This project is a second reincarnation of [Mipt-Vis](http://code.google.com/p/mipt-vis) project.
